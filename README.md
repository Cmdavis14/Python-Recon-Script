# Python-Recon-Script

## Objective

The objective of the Python Recon Script is to develop a sophisticated website information gathering tool using Python. This tool is engineered to streamline the process of extracting critical insights about target websites, thereby facilitating comprehensive security assessments, strategic intelligence gathering, and thorough website analysis. 

### Skills Learned

- Network Scanning and Analysis: this project involved automating repetitive tasks involved in website information gathering.
- Information Retrieval and Analysis: skills were developed through extracting and analyzing data about websites from various sources.
- Security Assessment and Reporting: created directories and writing data to files to organize gathered informaiton and facilitate easy access and analysis.
- Critical Thinking and Problem-Solving: identified potential challenges in website information gathering, such as handling various URL formats, resolving domain names, and ensuring compatibility with different operating systems. Implemented oslutions to address these challenges, such as using the 'tldextract' library to extract domain names from URLs, implementing error handling mechanisms to handle exceptions, and testing the tool across different environments to ensure compatibility and reliability.
